Sep 28, 2022Friday, the S&P 500 stock index fell below its mid-June low of 3,666, wiping out the summer rebound. Fuelled by fears of rising inflation and global recession, the rout swept up bonds, energy, metals — pretty much everything except the U.S. dollar.

This has more to do with the outsized value creation in Tech and other sectors over the same period than a disconnect between WTI and Energy company value. The S&P 500 is an index, value is relative to its constituent market cap by company.

Aug 12, 2022The S&P 500's earnings increased 6.7% for Q2 2022, mostly driven by the energy sector. The index would be reporting a loss in earnings of 3.7% YoY if the sector were omitted.

Aug 12, 2022 6 of the S&P 500's 11 sectors have reported positive earnings growth in the quarter. But if we take energy out of the equation, the second quarter is a bit more dodgy.
‌ In fact, this growth rate of 6.7% would flip to a decline of 3.7% if energy were excluded from the index.

In the S&P 500 there are 60 consumer discretionary companies and 21 energy companies.

I'm not arguing Exxon or Tesla should be in or out of ESG

I'm just discussing how the index is constructed to represent broad US market but favor companies with ESG characteristics.

important to note that as markets mature over long time periods, volatility should decrease.  Plus, the S&P 500 has evolved so much over past 40 years, since 1980 energy stocks went from ~25% of the index to 4%! This bear market could repeat history, but I’m more optimistic

Interestingly, that's less than the increase in 12m forward earnings - meaning the PE ratio of the sector has actually fallen.

It's now trading at a 42% discount to the index - in it's bottom percentile (since 1999).

This is a good point.  But a broad-based index is a collection of sectors you are 'picking.'  In 2006/2007 the S&P 500 had a large position in financials and energy.  In 2000 it was technology and telecoms.  You could have avoided the downside by picking better S&P 500 sectors.

Jan 5, 2022However:

“The WilderHill Clean Energy Index (ECO) posted a 2021 decline of 30%. However, it had outsized gains for two straight years: 58% in 2019 and a record-setting 203% in 2020. 

Aggregating the past three years, the ECO gained 232%, more than double the S&P 500’s 92%.”

Jan 5, 2022It's very telling to see the relative performance of fossil fuel stocks versus Green Energy stocks. In 2021 the S&P 500 Energy Index was up 48% while the S&P Clean Energy Index was DOWN by 24%. So much for ESG investment and the greening of our finance markets.

Dec 30, 2021Quite a different picture than a year ago!  S&P Energy Index was down 37% to the S&P 500's +15.7%.

Yes, 4% weighting is a long ways from energy's peak 16% in 2008. Those days aren't coming back. But investors also haven't abandoned oil and gas for good, as some feared last year.

Yes, but when energy falls from 10% of S&P 500 to 3% of S&P 500, the fall in everyone's portfolio compared to the fall in the energy sector vs. the rest of the market is equal. Someone will still be overweight the sector vs the index and someone will be underweight.

Mar 18, 2021A plunge of more than -7% in crude oil prices on Thursday weighed on energy stocks and undercut the S&P 500 Index .
An increase in the 10-year T-note yield on Thursday to a 13-month high of +1.753% fueled concern that higher mortgage rates will undercut the U.S housing market.

Every stock in S&P 500 index gets a score for environmental social and governance driving what is inside $SNPE. I don’t have this data but it is important to look beyond the “E”. Energy companies are judged for other factors not just environmental ones.

Oct 29, 2020The energy sector used to be 16% of the S&P 500 index.

In hindsight, that was the peak as Oil hit $150 per barrel. 

That was the time to be reducing or completely selling out your holdings.

And what about today? Should you still be negative, as index weight drops below 2%?

It happened: the energy sector is officially the smallest component of the S&P500. On the way down this year it passed utilities, real estate, and finally materials. Current weighting 2.34%, down from 15.96% in June 2008.

Aug 29, 2020'Big Oil' is becoming small!

Energy became the smallest sector with just 2.34% in the S&P index that looks at the fortunes of the biggest 500 companies on the stock market. Down by ~5x in 10 yrs. It's another piece of writing on the wall showing the age of fossil fuel is ending.

Energy has been the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 in recent years, so it has paid to avoid fossil fuel stocks. noting that oil and gas companies now account for just 4.4% of the S&P 500, while in 1980 they represented more than 28% of the index.

Pretty decent Time article in the slow shift in O&G behaviour on CC. The fundamental problem is that firms are not moral or security entities; they live & die on profit. We count on government to enforce our security, & govt moves when people demand it to. https://time.com/5766188/shell-oil-companies-fossil-fuels-climate-change/…

This is beyond maddening. Not everyone knew, because the oil industry worked for 3 decades to cover it up. Your greed wasted our best chance at survival
